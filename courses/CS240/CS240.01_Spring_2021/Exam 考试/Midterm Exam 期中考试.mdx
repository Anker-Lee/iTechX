@ problem - checkbox
title: "Question 3"
content: """
Let $X$ and $Y$ be two decision problems. Suppose we know that $X \leq_p Y$. Which of the following can we infer?
"""
choice: """
If $Y$ is NP-complete, then so is $X$.
If $Y$ is NP-complete and $X$ is in NP, then $X$ is NP-complete.
If $X$ is NP-complete and $Y$ is in NP, then $Y$ is NP-complete.
$X$ and $Y$ can't both be NP-complete.
If $Y$ is in P, then $X$ is in P.
